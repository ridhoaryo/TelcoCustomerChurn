# Introduction

The Small Business Administration (SBA) was founded in 1953 to assist small businesses in obtaining loans. Small businesses have been the primary source of employment in the United States. Helping small businesses help with job creation, which reduces unemployment. Small business growth also promotes economic growth. One of the ways the SBA helps small businesses is by guaranteeing bank loans. This guarantee reduces the risk to banks and encourages them to lend to small businesses. If the loan defaults, the SBA covers the amount guaranteed, and the bank suffers a loss for the remaining balance.

There have been several small business success stories like FedEx and Apple. However, the rate of default is very high. Many economists believe the banking market works better without the assistance of the SBA. Supporter claim that the social benefits and job creation outweigh any financial costs to the government in defaulted loans.

## What to do

Through this project, I will try to build a Machine Learning model that can predict which customer is going to churn or is still with us.

## __Goal__

The model can predict which customer that are going to leave or stay, so that cost allocation can be determined as precisely as possible.

## Value

Minimized Acquisition Cost.

## Dataset

The dataset that I will use is from Kaggle.com. You may visit the dataset through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset).

This dataset contains 33 variables (columns) and 7043 observations (rows).
